- Do not create DB at startup but nag

- Capped collection creation

- Why does test2.csv generate JS errors when rendering graphs....

- Sort out caching issues (client side particularly; tell nocache in
   response headers?: "Cache-Control", "Expires", "Pragma: no-cache")

- The content vs. page issue: ideally dataroses does not return a
   rendered template with full head+body html code but just the svg
   element plus all js necesary to make it run and a class field
   defining its id for on the fly CSS formatting. But for testing and
   standalone issue is handy if it returns a page. (GET parameter
   ?type=x to the rescue?)
